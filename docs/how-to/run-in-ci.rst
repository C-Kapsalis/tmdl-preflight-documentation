Run in CI
=========

Goal: fail a pull request when a PBIP semantic model carries a defect,
without CI ever mutating the repository.

The one rule of CI usage
----------------------------

CI checks; developers fix. Run ``tmdl-preflight check`` (read-only) in
the pipeline. Auto-fixes belong on a developer's machine, where the
diff gets reviewed and committed like any other change.

GitHub Actions
------------------

::

    name: tmdl-preflight
    on:
      pull_request:
        paths:
          - "**/*.SemanticModel/**"
          - "**/*.Report/**"

    jobs:
      preflight:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v4
          - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
            with:
              python-version: "3.12"
          - run: pip install tmdl-preflight
          - run: tmdl-preflight check . --strict

``--strict`` makes warnings fail the job as well as errors. Drop it if
you only want hard failures to block.

Azure DevOps
---------------

::

    steps:
      - task: UsePythonVersion@0
        inputs:
          versionSpec: "3.12"
      - script: pip install tmdl-preflight
      - script: tmdl-preflight check $(Build.SourcesDirectory) --strict
        displayName: TMDL preflight

Scoping and tuning
----------------------

- Check one model in a multi-model repo: pass the specific folder,
  ``tmdl-preflight check src/Finance.SemanticModel``.
- Silence an advisory rule that does not apply to your architecture
  (for example S001 in a model that formats via calculation groups):
  ``tmdl-preflight check . --ignore S001``.
- Gate on a subset while you clean up legacy debt:
  ``tmdl-preflight check . --select M002,M003,D001,R001``.

Machine-readable output
----------------------------

For annotations or dashboards, use ``--json`` and parse the payload:

::

    $ tmdl-preflight check . --json > preflight.json

::

    {
      "summary": {"errors": 1, "warnings": 0, "infos": 0, "fixes_applied": 0},
      "fixes": [],
      "violations": [
        {
          "rule": "M003",
          "severity": "error",
          "message": "lineageTag '...' duplicates the one on table Products (...)",
          "file": ".../tables/Stores.tmdl",
          "line": 3,
          "object": "table Stores",
          "fixable": true
        }
      ]
    }

Exit codes: ``0`` clean, ``1`` violations (errors; warnings too under
``--strict``), ``2`` usage or path errors, so a missing model folder
fails the job loudly instead of passing vacuously.
