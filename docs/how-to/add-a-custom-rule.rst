Add a custom rule
=================

Goal: enforce a convention of your own, say, "every visible table must
have a description," with the same engine, CLI selection, and
optionally auto-fix machinery the built-in rules use.

1. Subclass ``Rule``
------------------------

A rule is a class with four attributes and a ``check()`` method:

::

    from tmdl_preflight import Rule, Severity
    from tmdl_preflight.rules.base import Context, Violation


    class TableDescriptionRule(Rule):
        id = "X001"                      # unique; pick a prefix outside M/D/R/F/B/S
        name = "table-descriptions"
        severity = Severity.WARNING
        description = "Visible tables should carry a /// description comment."

        def check(self, ctx: Context) -> list[Violation]:
            out = []
            for model in ctx.models:                    # parsed SemanticModel(s)
                for table in model.tables.values():
                    if table.is_hidden:
                        continue
                    text = table.file.read_text(encoding="utf-8")
                    if not text.lstrip().startswith("///"):
                        out.append(self.violation(
                            "visible table has no /// description",
                            file=table.file,
                            line=table.line,
                            obj=table.name,
                        ))
            return out

What ``ctx`` gives you:

- ``ctx.models``: a list of parsed ``SemanticModel`` objects (tables,
  columns, measures, relationships, lineage tags, ``dax_blocks()``).
- ``ctx.report_dirs``: every ``*.Report`` folder found, for
  report-side rules.
- ``ctx.reload()``: drops the parse cache; the engine calls it after
  fixes.

2. Optionally, add a fixer
-------------------------------

Set ``fixable = True`` and implement ``fix()``. Respect the safety
contract: a fixer only repairs what its rule's failure mode describes,
is idempotent, and never overwrites human-authored semantics.

::

        fixable = True

        def fix(self, ctx: Context) -> list[str]:
            applied = []
            for model in ctx.models:
                for table in model.tables.values():
                    ...  # edit table.file surgically, then:
                    applied.append(f"{table.file.name}: added description stub")
            return applied

Return one human-readable string per change; the engine prints them
and re-checks from disk afterwards. If your fixer did not actually
resolve the violation, the re-check will say so; you do not need to
verify yourself.

3. Run it
-------------

Build a ``RuleSet`` that includes your rule and hand it to the engine:

::

    from tmdl_preflight import Context, check, default_ruleset
    from tmdl_preflight.rules.base import RuleSet

    ruleset = default_ruleset()
    ruleset.rules.append(TableDescriptionRule())

    report = check(Context("MyProject/"), ruleset)
    for v in report.violations:
        print(v.rule_id, v.message)

Inside pytest the same works through the fixture's building blocks,
or run the report yourself and assert on it:

::

    def test_custom_convention():
        report = check(Context("MyProject/"), ruleset)
        assert not report.errors

4. Test it like the built-ins
----------------------------------

Follow the pattern in ``tests/test_rules_*.py``: copy a clean fixture
model into ``tmp_path``, mutate it to trigger exactly your failure
mode, assert the violation is detected, and, if you wrote a fixer,
assert that fix then re-check comes back clean and that the fix is
idempotent.
