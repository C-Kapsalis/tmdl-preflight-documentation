``tmdl-preflight`` is a preflight linter and auto-fixer for Power BI
semantic models saved in TMDL format (PBIP folders): it catches the
defects that stop Power BI Desktop from opening a project, missing
``ref table`` lines, tables with no partition, inline ``#table``
entity sources, duplicate or malformed lineage tags, field-parameter
comma runs, and mechanically repairs the ones whose fix is fully
determined by the failure.

Contributions are welcome: new rules, fixers, docs, and bug reports.
This page covers how to set up, where things live, and how to add a
rule.

Development setup
---------------------

The tool has zero runtime dependencies (standard library only, Python
3.10 or later); the only dev dependency is pytest.

::

    $ git clone https://github.com/C-Kapsalis/tmdl-preflight.git
    $ cd tmdl-preflight
    $ python -m venv .venv
    $ source .venv/bin/activate
    $ pip install -e ".[test]"
    $ pytest

(On Windows, activate with ``.venv\\Scripts\\activate`` instead.)
``pip install -e .`` puts the ``tmdl-preflight`` console command on
your PATH and registers the ``tmdl_preflight`` pytest plugin. Verify
with:

::

    $ tmdl-preflight --version

    tmdl-preflight 0.1.0

The full Diátaxis documentation (a tutorial, how-to guides, and
reference pages) lives in this separate ``tmdl-preflight-documentation``
repository, published on Read the Docs.

Each rule has an ``id`` (``M003``), a ``name`` (``lineage-duplicates``),
a ``Severity`` (``ERROR``/``WARNING``/``INFO``), and a one-paragraph
``description``. A rule's ``check()`` returns ``Violation``\\s; a rule
that can repair its own violation class sets ``fixable = True`` and
implements ``fix()``.

Adding a new rule
---------------------

1. Subclass ``Rule`` in the appropriate ``rules/*.py`` module, or a new
   one. Give it a unique ``id``, a ``name``, a ``severity``, and a
   ``description``, then implement
   ``check(self, ctx) -> list[Violation]``:

   ::

       from .base import Context, Rule, Severity, Violation

       class TableDescriptionRule(Rule):
           id = "X001"                 # unique; pick a prefix outside M/D/R/F/B/S
           name = "table-descriptions"
           severity = Severity.WARNING
           description = "Visible tables should carry a /// description comment."

           def check(self, ctx: Context) -> list[Violation]:
               out = []
               for model in ctx.models:
                   for table in model.tables.values():
                       if not table.is_hidden and needs_description(table):
                           out.append(self.violation(
                               "visible table has no /// description",
                               file=table.file, line=table.line, obj=table.name,
                           ))
               return out

   ``ctx.models`` are parsed ``SemanticModel``\\s; ``ctx.report_dirs``
   are the ``*.Report`` folders for report-side rules; ``ctx.reload()``
   drops the parse cache (the engine calls it after fixers run).

2. Optionally add a fixer. Set ``fixable = True`` and implement
   ``fix(self, ctx) -> list[str]``, returning one human-readable line
   per change. Honor the safety contract: only repair what the failure
   fully determines, be idempotent, make minimal line-level edits, and
   never overwrite human-authored semantics (names, DAX,
   relationships). The engine re-checks from disk afterward, so a
   fixer never vouches for itself.

3. Register it in ``src/tmdl_preflight/rules/__init__.py``: import the
   class and add it to the ``ALL_RULES`` list.

4. Add a test in ``tests/`` (see Testing, below).

5. Document it: add an entry to the rule catalog in this
   documentation's :doc:`reference/usage`, and update
   :doc:`how-to/modify-the-rules-list` or
   :doc:`how-to/modify-the-auto-fixes` if the change is substantial
   enough to affect the recipe those pages teach.

Testing
-----------

Tests live in ``tests/``, one ``test_rules_*.py`` file per rule
module. The shared fixtures in ``tests/conftest.py`` give you a
pristine copy of the Pedal and Sprocket Bike Co. model:

- ``project``, a disposable copy of the clean model in ``tmp_path``,
  safe to mutate.
- ``definition``/``report_dir``, the model and report folders inside
  it.
- ``clean_project``, the pristine fixture; never mutate it.

Follow the built-in pattern: copy the clean fixture, break exactly one
thing to trigger your failure mode, assert the violation is detected,
and, for a fixer, assert that fix, then re-check, comes back clean and
that a second fix is a no-op (idempotent). For example:

::

    def test_duplicate_lineage_tag_is_flagged(project, definition):
        stores = definition / "tables" / "Stores.tmdl"
        # ...copy Products' lineageTag onto Stores, then:
        violations = LineageTagUniquenessRule().check(Context(project))
        assert any(v.rule_id == "M003" for v in violations)

Before you open a PR
-------------------------

Run both of these; both must pass:

::

    $ pytest

::

    $ tmdl-preflight check examples/bike-shop-clean

    tmdl-preflight: 0 error(s), 0 warning(s), 0 info(s)

The second command is the end-to-end smoke test: the shipped clean
example must stay clean. If you touched a fixer, also confirm
``tmdl-preflight fix`` on a copy of ``examples/bike-shop-broken``
clears the four blockers and leaves only the S001 info finding.

Commit and PR conventions
------------------------------

- Branch off ``main``; keep each PR focused on one rule, fix, or
  topic.
- Write imperative, present-tense commit subjects ("Add M009
  partition-mode rule," not "Added..."); keep the subject under about
  seventy-two characters and explain the why in the body when it is
  not obvious.
- Keep auto-fix changes to a model in their own commit so reviewers
  can wave them through.
- A PR should describe what it changes and why, note any new or
  changed rule ids, and confirm that ``pytest`` and the clean-example
  check both pass.

Reporting issues
---------------------

Open an issue on the `GitHub tracker
<https://github.com/C-Kapsalis/tmdl-preflight/issues>`_ with:

- what you ran, the exact ``tmdl-preflight`` command and flags,
- what you expected versus what happened (paste the report output),
- your Python version and OS, and
- a minimal TMDL/PBIP snippet that reproduces it, if you can share
  one.

Security-sensitive reports should go to the maintainer privately
rather than a public issue.
