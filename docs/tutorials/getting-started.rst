Getting started
===============

In this tutorial you will install ``tmdl-preflight``, check a clean
semantic model, check a deliberately broken copy of the same model,
repair the blockers with the auto-fixer, and learn to read the one
advisory finding that remains. It takes about ten minutes and assumes
nothing beyond a working Python 3.10 or later installation.

1. Install
-------------

From a clone of this repository (the ``[test]`` extra pulls in
pytest, which you will want for the later steps anyway):

::

    $ pip install -e ".[test]"
    $ tmdl-preflight --version
    tmdl-preflight 0.1.0

2. Meet the example models
------------------------------

The repository ships two copies of a small fictional PBIP project, the
Pedal and Sprocket Bike Co. model, under ``examples/``:

::

    examples/
    |-- bike-shop-clean/            # every rule passes; opens in Power BI
    |   |-- BikeShop.SemanticModel/
    |   |   `-- definition/
    |   |       |-- model.tmdl
    |   |       |-- relationships.tmdl
    |   |       `-- tables/
    |   |           |-- __Calendar.tmdl
    |   |           |-- Metric Selector.tmdl
    |   |           |-- Products.tmdl
    |   |           |-- Sales Measures.tmdl
    |   |           |-- Sales.tmdl
    |   |           `-- Stores.tmdl
    |   `-- BikeShop.Report/
    `-- bike-shop-broken/           # same model, 4 blockers + 1 style nudge

This is exactly the folder shape Power BI Desktop produces when you
save a project as PBIP (File, then Save as, then Power BI project
files), so everything below works the same on your own models.

3. Check the clean model
----------------------------

Point ``check`` at the project root (it also accepts a
``*.SemanticModel`` folder, a ``definition`` folder, or a ``*.Report``
folder):

::

    $ tmdl-preflight check examples/bike-shop-clean

    tmdl-preflight: 0 error(s), 0 warning(s), 0 info(s)

Exit code 0: the model is clean and opens in Power BI Desktop.
``check`` is strictly read-only; it never touches your files.

4. Check the broken model
-----------------------------

``bike-shop-broken`` is the same project after a bad week: a table
lost its ``ref table`` line, a table file was copy-pasted, a lineage
tag was hand-typed as a placeholder, and a field-parameter row was
deleted without its comma. The result will not open in Power BI
Desktop. Four of those defects are blockers Power BI rejects on open;
the fifth is a style nudge. The examples README lists exactly what is
seeded where; here is what ``check`` makes of it:

::

    $ tmdl-preflight check examples/bike-shop-broken
    BikeShop.SemanticModel\definition\tables\Metric Selector.tmdl:45  F001 error: stray comma run (1 orphan comma(s)) in calculated partition source [Metric Selector (partition source)] (auto-fixable)
    BikeShop.SemanticModel\definition\tables\Sales Measures.tmdl:17  S001 info: visible measure has no formatString, so it renders with the engine's default formatting. Add a formatString, or run with --ignore S001 if your formatting strategy lives elsewhere. [Sales Measures[Units Sold]]
    BikeShop.SemanticModel\definition\tables\Stores.tmdl  M006 error: table 'Stores' is defined in tables/ but has no 'ref table' line in model.tmdl, so it is not part of the model and Power BI will not open the project. Add: ref table Stores [Stores] (auto-fixable)
    BikeShop.SemanticModel\definition\tables\Stores.tmdl:3  M003 error: lineageTag 'e689596a-59ea-4b2c-a14d-48596a7b8c9d' duplicates the one on table Products (Products.tmdl:3) [table Stores] (auto-fixable)
    BikeShop.SemanticModel\definition\tables\__Calendar.tmdl:4  M004 warning: lineageTag 'calendar-tag-TODO' is not a canonical UUID [table __Calendar] (auto-fixable)

    tmdl-preflight: 3 error(s), 1 warning(s), 1 info(s)

Exit code 1. Every line names the file (and line where one exists),
the rule id, the severity, what is wrong, and, where the tool can
repair it, the ``(auto-fixable)`` marker:

- M006 (``Stores`` has no ``ref table`` line): the table is not
  attached to the model, so Power BI refuses to open the project.
- M003 (``Stores`` copied ``Products``' ``lineageTag``): the deploy
  target rejects duplicate lineage tags.
- M004 (``__Calendar``'s ``lineageTag`` is a ``TODO`` placeholder, not
  a UUID).
- F001 (a deleted field-parameter row left an orphan comma): the
  calculated partition source no longer parses.
- S001 (the visible measure ``Units Sold`` has no ``formatString``):
  an advisory nudge, not a blocker; the model opens fine without it.

Four findings carry the ``(auto-fixable)`` marker; S001 does not. That
split is the whole design: a defect earns an auto-fix only when the
failure itself fully determines the repair.

5. Fix a copy
-----------------

``fix`` edits files in place, so work on a copy and keep the broken
original for rereading this tutorial:

::

    $ cp -r examples/bike-shop-broken /tmp/bike-shop
    $ tmdl-preflight fix /tmp/bike-shop
    fixed  M006: model.tmdl: + ref table Stores
    fixed  M003: Stores.tmdl:3 (table Stores): 'e689596a-59ea-4b2c-a14d-48596a7b8c9d' -> '1556d6dd-6012-4be4-8d04-6383081d6e02'
    fixed  M004: __Calendar.tmdl:4 (table __Calendar): 'calendar-tag-TODO' -> '1e41940d-23a7-4d0f-b260-4c40ecdd16fa'
    fixed  F001: Metric Selector.tmdl: removed 1 orphan comma(s) from 'Metric Selector' partition source

    BikeShop.SemanticModel\definition\tables\Sales Measures.tmdl:17  S001 info: visible measure has no formatString, so it renders with the engine's default formatting. Add a formatString, or run with --ignore S001 if your formatting strategy lives elsewhere. [Sales Measures[Units Sold]]

    tmdl-preflight: 0 error(s), 0 warning(s), 1 info(s), 4 fix(es) applied

The regenerated UUIDs are random, so yours will differ. Three things
happened, in order:

#. every rule ran (``check``),
#. the fixers of the failed auto-fixable rules ran: the missing
   ``ref table Stores`` line was appended to ``model.tmdl``, the
   duplicate lineage tag was regenerated (the original in
   ``Products.tmdl`` was left alone), the placeholder tag became a
   real UUID, and the orphan comma was deleted,
#. every rule ran again, from disk, and the report you see is that
   re-check.

Exit code 0, because the re-check came back clean of blockers, not
because fixers ran. The four blockers are gone and the project now
opens in Power BI Desktop. Only the S001 info line remains, and info
never blocks. That check, fix, re-check loop is the imposition
pattern; see :doc:`../explanation/imposition-pattern` for why the
re-check is not optional. Running ``fix`` a second time applies zero
fixes and reports the same single info line; the fixers are
idempotent.

Diff the copy against ``examples/bike-shop-broken`` before you move
on: every auto-fix is a one-line (or one-value) change, so the review
is trivial.

6. Read what remains
------------------------

Re-run ``check`` on the repaired copy:

::

    $ tmdl-preflight check /tmp/bike-shop
    BikeShop.SemanticModel\definition\tables\Sales Measures.tmdl:17  S001 info: visible measure has no formatString, so it renders with the engine's default formatting. Add a formatString, or run with --ignore S001 if your formatting strategy lives elsewhere. [Sales Measures[Units Sold]]

    tmdl-preflight: 0 error(s), 0 warning(s), 1 info(s)

Exit code 0. One finding stays, and it stays on purpose: S001 is an
info-level nudge, not a defect that stops the model from opening. The
message tells you the problem and your options, but the choice is
yours; give ``Units Sold`` a ``formatString`` if you format measures on
the model, or run with ``--ignore S001`` if your formatting strategy
lives elsewhere (a calculation group, a theme). A tool that forced one
answer would be imposing a house style, not repairing a break. Add a
``formatString`` yourself and re-run ``check`` to see the same
all-clear the clean model shows:

::

    $ tmdl-preflight check examples/bike-shop-clean

    tmdl-preflight: 0 error(s), 0 warning(s), 0 info(s)

7. Explore the rest
------------------------

::

    $ tmdl-preflight rules                                            # the full catalog
    $ tmdl-preflight check examples/bike-shop-broken --select M006    # one rule only
    $ tmdl-preflight check examples/bike-shop-broken --json           # machine-readable
    $ tmdl-preflight check examples/bike-shop-broken --strict         # warnings fail too

Where to go next
--------------------

- Wire it into your pipeline: :doc:`../how-to/run-in-ci`.
- Use it from your test suite: :doc:`../how-to/run-in-pytest`.
- Understand what each rule protects you from: the explanation guides
  linked from :doc:`../index`.
- Everything the CLI accepts: :doc:`../reference/cli`.
