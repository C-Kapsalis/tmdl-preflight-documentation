::

    tmdl-preflight [--version] [--rules] <command> [options]

Commands
-----------

``tmdl-preflight check <path>``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run every selected rule and report violations. Strictly read-only.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Option
     - Effect
   * - ``--select IDS``
     - Comma-separated rule ids or names to run (default: all).
       Case-insensitive.
   * - ``--ignore IDS``
     - Comma-separated rule ids or names to skip.
   * - ``--json``
     - Emit the machine-readable report instead of text.
   * - ``--strict``
     - Exit nonzero on warnings as well as errors.

``tmdl-preflight fix <path>``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run every selected rule; for each fixable rule that reported
violations, apply its auto-fix; then re-run every selected rule from
disk and report what remains. Takes the same options as ``check``.

The exit code reflects the post-fix state: ``0`` means the re-check
came back clean, ``1`` means violations survived the repair (or were
never fixable).

``tmdl-preflight rules``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Print the rule catalog (id, name, severity, fixability, description).
``--json`` emits it as a JSON array. The top-level flag
``tmdl-preflight --rules`` is an alias.

``<path>`` resolution
-------------------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - You pass
     - tmdl-preflight uses
   * - a PBIP project root
     - every ``*.SemanticModel/definition`` and every ``*.Report``
       found beneath it
   * - a ``*.SemanticModel`` folder
     - its ``definition/``
   * - a ``definition`` folder (has ``tables/``)
     - itself
   * - a ``*.Report`` folder
     - itself (report-side rules only)

Multiple models or reports under one root are all checked in a single
run.

Exit codes
-------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Code
     - Meaning
   * - ``0``
     - clean (after fixes, for ``fix``)
   * - ``1``
     - violations remain, errors, or warnings with ``--strict``
   * - ``2``
     - usage error: path missing, nothing to check, unknown rule id,
       empty rule selection

Text output format
----------------------

::

    <file>:<line>  <RULE> <severity>: <message> [<object>] (auto-fixable)

Files are shown relative to the checked path when possible. ``fix``
runs prefix the report with one ``fixed  <RULE>: <description>`` line
per applied repair.

JSON output format
----------------------

::

    {
      "summary": {
        "errors": 0,
        "warnings": 0,
        "infos": 0,
        "fixes_applied": 1
      },
      "fixes": ["M003: Stores.tmdl:3 (table Stores): '...' -> '...'"],
      "violations": [
        {
          "rule": "M003",
          "severity": "error",
          "message": "...",
          "file": "...",
          "line": 3,
          "object": "table Stores",
          "fixable": true
        }
      ]
    }

``violations`` reflects the final state of the run (post-fix for
``fix``).

Environment
--------------

The CLI reads no environment variables. The pytest fixture honors
``TMDL_PREFLIGHT_AUTOFIX=1`` as a default for its ``autofix``
parameter; see :doc:`../how-to/run-in-pytest`.
