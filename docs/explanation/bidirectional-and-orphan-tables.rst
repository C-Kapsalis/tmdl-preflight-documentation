Bidirectional filters and orphan tables
=========================================

Rules R004 and R005.

These two rules are advisories (``info`` severity; they never fail a
run). They exist because the absence of a defect is not the same as
the presence of a healthy topology, and two topology smells are worth
surfacing on every run.

Bidirectional cross-filtering (R004)
------------------------------------------

A relationship normally filters one way: the dimension filters the
fact. ``crossFilteringBehavior: bothDirections`` makes filtering flow
both ways, sometimes genuinely necessary (classic many-to-many
bridges), but carrying two well-documented hazards:

- Ambiguity. With enough bidirectional edges, multiple filter paths
  can connect the same two tables, and the engine's choice of path
  can produce results that are correct by its rules and baffling to
  the analyst.
- Performance. Every bidirectional edge widens the subgraph the
  engine must consider for each query.

The hazard compounds silently: each individual ``bothDirections``
looked reasonable when added; the set of them is what creates an
ambiguous mesh. So the rule surfaces every occurrence, every run, not
because any one is wrong, but because each one should be
re-confirmed as intentional whenever the model changes around it. No
fixer exists, or should: the fix for an intentional bridge is
nothing, and for an accidental one it is a modelling decision.

Orphan tables (R005)
-------------------------

A table with data columns that participates in no relationship
usually means one of: a load leftover from an abandoned experiment, a
table whose relationships were deleted with intent to re-add (and
forgotten), or a genuinely standalone reference table. The first two
are debt; they bloat the model, confuse users in the field list, and
any measure over them silently ignores every slicer.

The rule is careful about what counts, because healthy models contain
many tables that are orphans by design:

- measure-home tables (no columns at all, or only hidden placeholder
  columns; Power BI requires at least one column per table, so
  measure tables typically carry one hidden column nobody uses),
- hidden tables (mapping and staging helpers a modeler deliberately
  keeps out of the field list),
- field parameters (detected through their parameter metadata),
- calculated helper tables (all columns calculated, or a calculated
  partition; parameter tables, what-if tables, calendars pending
  wiring).

Only tables with real, visible data columns and zero relationship
participation are reported, as info, for a human to classify.
Deliberate disconnected slicer tables (a static list of options read
with ``SELECTEDVALUE``) fall in this group and will keep surfacing;
that is by design, info never fails a run, but you can silence the
rule with ``--ignore R005`` if your model uses the pattern heavily.
There is nothing to auto-fix: deleting a table is destructive and
wiring a relationship requires knowing the join key, both firmly
human decisions.
