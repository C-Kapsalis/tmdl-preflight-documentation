Layered testing
===============

``tmdl-preflight``'s rules are organized the way mature BI test suites
organize their checks: in layers, ordered by how early the defect can
be caught and how much infrastructure the check needs. Understanding
the layers explains both the rule ids and what this tool deliberately
does not try to do.

The layers
-------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Layer
     - Question
     - Rules
     - Needs
   * - Structural
     - Do the files even parse? Is identity metadata sound?
     - M001-M005
     - the files
   * - Expression
     - Is the DAX lexically sound and are its references real?
     - D001-D003
     - a parsed model
   * - Model integration
     - Do cross-object structures cohere, relationships, field
       parameters?
     - R001-R005, F001
     - a parsed model
   * - Report
     - Does the report layer agree with itself?
     - B001, B002
     - the ``*.Report`` folder
   * - Advisory
     - Is the model following good practice?
     - S001 (and R004/R005 by severity)
     - a parsed model

The ordering is diagnostic, not just taxonomic. A defect at one layer
routinely causes noise at higher layers: a table file that does not
parse (M002) makes every relationship into it look broken (R001), and
a stray comma in a field-parameter source (F001) makes every
``NAMEOF`` inside it unresolvable (D002). When a run reports
violations at several layers, fix the lowest layer first and re-run;
much of the rest usually evaporates.

Everything here is "pre-flight"
------------------------------------

All layers share one property: they run locally, against files, in
seconds, with no credentials. That is the niche this tool occupies,
the checks you can afford to run on every save and must run before
every push.

Deliberately out of scope, because they need a live service or a
human:

- Deployment state: whether the model actually loaded, refreshed, and
  returns sensible numbers. That is a post-deploy smoke test.
- Data quality: whether the pipelines filled the tables correctly.
  That belongs to the data layer's own tests.
- Visual rendering: whether the report looks right. That is manual
  review.

A useful way to say it: ``tmdl-preflight`` verifies the definition,
not the deployment. Passing preflight means the model deserves the
much more expensive downstream verification; it does not replace it.

Severity encodes the layer's authority
--------------------------------------------

Structural and expression defects fail hard (``error``) because they
are facts: the import will reject a duplicate lineage tag. Advisory
rules (``info``) never block, because they encode judgement, and
judgement belongs to the modeler: three bidirectional relationships
might be exactly right for your model. The ``warning`` tier in
between (``--strict`` promotes it to blocking) covers things that are
almost always wrong but have legitimate exceptions.

This is also why the advisory rules do not grow fixers. An auto-fix
that "repairs" a bidirectional filter would be the tool overruling the
modeler on a judgement call, precisely what the imposition pattern's
safety contract forbids (see :doc:`imposition-pattern`).

Using layers in practice
-----------------------------

- Inner loop (editing): ``--select M002,D001``, parse and delimiter
  confidence in well under a second.
- Pre-push: the full default set.
- CI: the full set with ``--strict``, read-only. See
  :doc:`../how-to/run-in-ci`.
