DAX delimiter balance
=====================

Rule D001.

The pitfall
--------------

An unbalanced parenthesis in a measure sounds like the kind of error
that cannot possibly survive to a commit; Power BI Desktop's formula
bar would have refused it. And that intuition is exactly why it does
survive: once a model lives in text files, most edits never pass
through the formula bar. Delimiter damage arrives through:

- Merges. A conflict resolution keeps the ``CALCULATE(`` from one
  side and the closing of the other side's shorter expression.
- Scripted refactors. A rename script that matches a little too
  much, a template that emits one ``)`` too few.
- Hand edits to a fenced multi-line expression, where the closing
  delimiter is forty lines from the opening one.

The cost profile is asymmetric. The defective measure itself fails
loudly, but in TMDL, an expression's textual boundary is defined by
indentation and fences, so a runaway string or bracket can also
confuse where the next object begins, corrupting the parse of
neighbours that are themselves perfectly fine. And expressions
outside measures are easy to forget: calculated-table sources,
calculation items, and dynamic format strings carry DAX too. A syntax
error in a calculation group's format string is particularly vicious,
because it breaks every visual that touches the calculation group,
not just one measure.

Counting delimiters naively does not work, which is why "just grep
for unbalanced parens" fails in both directions. DAX comments
(``--``, ``//``, ``/* */``) legitimately contain unmatched
delimiters; string literals may contain ``")("``; quoted identifiers
may contain doubled escapes (``'It''s Fine'``); a measure name may
even contain ``--``. A checker that ignores this context drowns you
in false positives until you turn it off.

How the rule detects it
----------------------------

The checker runs a small character-class scanner over each
expression, tagging every position as code, string, quoted
identifier, bracketed identifier, or comment, honoring the escape
forms (``""``, ``''``, ``]]``). Balance is then enforced only over
code positions: parentheses and braces must nest correctly, and every
string, identifier, or bracket region must actually terminate. It
checks every DAX expression the model carries: measures, calculated
columns, calculated-partition sources, calculation items, and
format-string definitions.

This is deliberately not a DAX parser. It cannot tell you that
``SUMX`` got the wrong argument types; it tells you the expression is
lexically closed, the property whose violation corrupts files and
blocks imports. Semantic validation belongs to the engine, at deploy
time.

Why there is no auto-fix
-----------------------------

An unbalanced expression has unboundedly many balanced completions,
and only the author knows which one restores the intended logic.
Appending a ``)`` at the end would silence the checker while
changing, or preserving, the wrong semantics silently. This is the
canonical example of a defect that detects mechanically but repairs
only with intent, so it fails plainly and points at the line.

  expression closes, but do its references resolve?
