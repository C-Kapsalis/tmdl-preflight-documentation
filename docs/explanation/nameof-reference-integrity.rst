NAMEOF reference integrity
==========================

Rule D002.

The pitfall
--------------

``NAMEOF()`` returns the name of a column or measure as a string:
``NAMEOF([Revenue])`` becomes ``"Revenue"``. Its whole purpose is
refactoring safety; a rename should be caught where a hardcoded
string would silently rot.

The catch: that safety exists only where a DAX engine validates the
expression. In a PBIP repository, the expressions that lean hardest
on ``NAMEOF`` are the ones an engine validates last: field parameters.
A field parameter is a calculated table whose source is a list of
tuples:

::

    {
        ( "Revenue",             NAMEOF ( [Revenue] ),             0 ),
        ( "Orders #",            NAMEOF ( [Orders #] ),            1 ),
        ( "Average Order Value", NAMEOF ( [Average Order Value] ), 2 )
    }

and it is the standard mechanism for letting report users swap the
plotted measure. Now delete or rename ``Orders #`` in a text editor.
No formula bar fires. The model deploys. And at refresh or first use,
the field parameter's source fails to evaluate, which takes down not
one measure but every visual driven by the parameter, plus anything
downstream that reads the parameter table. One dangling reference,
sitting in a file nobody re-opened, disables a report page.

The same applies to ``NAMEOF`` inside ordinary measures and
calculation items, with a smaller blast radius.

How the rule detects it
----------------------------

Every ``NAMEOF()`` call in every DAX block is extracted (comments are
stripped first, so intentionally parked rows in a field parameter do
not count) and resolved against the parsed model:

- ``NAMEOF([X])``: some table must declare measure ``X``. If none
  does, that is an error. If several do, the reference is ambiguous
  and flagged as a warning (see :doc:`duplicate-measure-names`, which
  errors on the underlying cause).
- ``NAMEOF('T'[X])``: table ``T`` must exist and declare a column or
  measure named ``X``; a missing table or member is an error.
  Qualified references to measures are accepted as valid: Power BI
  Desktop itself writes ``NAMEOF('T'[Measure])`` when you add
  measures to a field parameter, so flagging that form would bury
  real breaks under hundreds of false alarms on production-size
  models.

Why there is no auto-fix
-----------------------------

A dangling ``NAMEOF([Orders #])`` has at least three legitimate
resolutions: the measure was renamed (retarget the reference), the
measure was removed on purpose (delete the tuple, and its separator,
see :doc:`field-parameter-comma-runs`), or the removal was itself the
mistake (restore the measure). Choosing requires intent the file does
not record. The rule's contribution is catching the break at edit
time, with the exact file and line, instead of at refresh time with a
report page down.
