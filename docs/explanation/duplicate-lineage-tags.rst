Duplicate and malformed lineage tags
=====================================

Rules M003 and M004.

The pitfall
--------------

Every object in a TMDL model, table, column, measure, partition,
relationship, carries a ``lineageTag``, a UUID that identifies the
object across renames and moves. Names are for humans; lineage tags
are how deployment tooling knows that the ``Revenue`` measure in this
commit is the same object as the ``Total Revenue`` measure in the
last one, so it can update rather than drop-and-recreate it.

That identity mechanism has one hard requirement: tags must be unique
within the model. When two objects share a tag, the deployment target
cannot tell them apart, and imports are rejected outright with a
message of the form "an object with that lineage tag already exists
in the collection." The model that looked perfectly healthy in your
editor is simply undeployable.

What makes this pitfall nasty is how easily duplicates appear and how
invisible they are:

- Copy-paste is the normal way to author TMDL. Duplicating a table
  file, or a measure block within one, duplicates every
  ``lineageTag`` inside it. Nothing in the file looks wrong
  afterwards; the tags are valid UUIDs, just not unique ones.
- Merges concatenate. A merge that keeps both sides of a conflicted
  measure block silently keeps both tags.
- The failure is far from the cause. The duplicate is introduced in
  an editor today and detected by a deployment pipeline days later,
  with an error message that names the tag but not the two files
  carrying it.

A cousin of the same problem is the malformed tag: a placeholder
typed by hand (``todo-fix-later``, ``not-a-real-uuid``) or produced by
a broken script. The engine may tolerate some of these, but they
defeat the purpose of the mechanism; a placeholder pasted into three
objects is three future duplicates, so ``tmdl-preflight`` flags any
tag that is not a canonical hyphenated UUID (8-4-4-4-12 hex).

How the rules detect it
----------------------------

The scan is deliberately blunt: every ``lineageTag:`` line in every
``.tmdl`` file under the definition folder is collected with its
file, line number, and nearest enclosing declaration
(table/column/measure/partition/relationship). M003 reports every
occurrence of a tag after its first; M004 reports every tag that
fails the canonical-UUID pattern. Working at the line level rather
than the object level means the check also catches tags on objects
the parser does not model deeply (hierarchies, for instance).

Why the fix is safe
------------------------

Regenerating a lineage tag is safe precisely because of what a
duplicate means: a duplicated tag carries no usable identity anyway.
The deployment target cannot use it to track either object, so
replacing the second occurrence with a fresh ``uuid4`` loses nothing;
it simply gives the copied object the new identity it should have
had from the start. The first occurrence, which usually belongs to
the original object, is never touched, so any deployment history
attached to it is preserved.

The mechanical properties follow the fixer safety contract: the edit
rewrites exactly one value on exactly one line (preserving the
file's newline style), touches no DAX and no names, and is
idempotent; once all tags are unique, there is nothing left to
rewrite. Malformed tags are repaired the same way, for the same
reason: a placeholder never carried real identity either.

One honest caveat: if the first occurrence was the copy and the
second the original, the regenerated object's deployment history is
the one that survives under the old tag. The model is still correct;
at worst, one object is recreated instead of updated on the next
deploy.
