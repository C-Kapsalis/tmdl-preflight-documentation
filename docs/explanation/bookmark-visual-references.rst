Bookmark visual references
==========================

Rule B002.

The pitfall
--------------

A bookmark captures the state of specific visuals, and it addresses
them by name, the identifier that is also the visual's folder name
under ``pages/<page>/visuals/<name>/``. The bookmark file and the
visual folder are separate artifacts, which sets up the same drift
problem as :doc:`relationships versus tables <relationship-integrity>`:
delete or rebuild a visual (rebuilding assigns a new name), and every
bookmark that captured it now points at nothing.

What makes this pitfall distinctive is that the failure is silent. A
dangling relationship blocks an import; a dangling bookmark reference
mostly does not. The bookmark still loads, still appears in the
bookmarks pane, still plays in the story sequence. It just quietly
fails to do part, or all, of what it was authored to do: the visual it
was meant to spotlight, hide, or filter is not addressed by anything.
The person who notices is not the developer but a report consumer,
weeks later, observing that "the presentation view stopped
highlighting the chart," a bug report that is miserable to trace back
to a visual rebuilt in some earlier sprint.

How the rule detects it
----------------------------

For each ``*.Report`` folder, the rule builds the set of actual
visual folder names under ``pages/*/visuals/``, then walks every
bookmark's references, ``explorationState.visualContainers`` (both
the keyed-object and the list forms) and
``options.targetVisualNames``, and reports every name with no
matching folder, per bookmark, per reference.

Why there is no auto-fix
-----------------------------

A dangling reference has three legitimate resolutions, and they point
in different directions:

#. the visual was deleted on purpose, so delete or re-author the
   bookmark;
#. the visual was rebuilt, so retarget the reference to the new name;
#. the deletion was the mistake, so restore the visual.

Choosing requires knowing why the visual disappeared, intent the
files do not record. An auto-fix that, say, pruned dangling
references would convert option three from "restore and everything
works again" into "restore and the bookmark still ignores it,"
actively destroying information. So the rule reports and fails; the
resolution stays human.
