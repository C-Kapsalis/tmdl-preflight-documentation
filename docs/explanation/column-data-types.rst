Column data types
=================

Rule M005.

The pitfall
--------------

Every column in a TMDL table declares a ``dataType``. The tabular
engine accepts a small closed set, ``string``, ``int64``, ``double``,
``decimal``, ``dateTime``, ``boolean``, ``binary``, ``variant``,
``currency``, ``rowNumber``, and nothing else.

The values look guessable, and that is the trap. A modeler hand-adding
a column writes ``dataType: text`` (a SQL habit), ``dataType: int``
(a programming habit), ``dataType: date`` or ``dataType: datetime``
(wrong casing; TMDL's property values are case-sensitive where the
engine's enum is). A scripted refactor maps types from a source
system and lets an unmapped value slip through. In every case the
file reads naturally; the model is rejected, or the tooling falls
back to a default type, which is worse, because a numeric column
typed as ``string`` deploys fine and then quietly breaks aggregation,
sorting, and every measure that sums it.

How the rule detects it
----------------------------

Every parsed column's declared ``dataType`` is compared against the
closed set above. Anything outside it is reported with the table,
column, file, and line. The severity is ``warning`` rather than
``error`` because the parser cannot be certain how a given deployment
path treats an unknown value, but in practice you should treat a hit
as a bug to fix before shipping.

Why there is no auto-fix
-----------------------------

The intended type is knowledge the file does not contain. ``text``
almost certainly means ``string``, but ``int`` could be ``int64`` or
``double`` (depending on whether the source can overflow or carry
nulls), and ``date`` could be ``dateTime`` deliberately narrowed
downstream. Guessing would convert a loud, early failure into a
quiet, late one, which is the exact opposite of this tool's job. The
rule points at the line; the human picks the type.
