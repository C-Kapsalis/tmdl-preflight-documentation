TMDL well-formedness
=====================

Rules M001 and M002.

The pitfall
--------------

TMDL's greatest strength, it is plain text, edited with ordinary
tools, is also its exposure. Between Power BI Desktop's serializer and
your deployment sit editors, merge drivers, shell scripts, and CI
checkouts, and every one of them can damage a file in ways that are
hard to spot:

- Truncated or missing files. An interrupted save, an overzealous
  ``.gitignore``, or a merge that resolves "delete versus modify" the
  wrong way can drop ``model.tmdl`` or empty the ``tables/`` folder.
  The remaining files are individually fine; the model as a whole is
  not.
- Encoding damage. TMDL is UTF-8. A file resaved in a legacy codepage,
  or corrupted in transfer, stops decoding, and a single undecodable
  file blocks the whole model import.
- Null bytes are the classic symptom of a bad merge or a tool writing
  binary content into a text file. They are invisible in most editors
  and fatal to most parsers.
- Unpaired expression fences. Multi-line DAX expressions are wrapped
  in ```` ``` ```` fences. Delete a measure but miss its closing
  fence, an easy mistake in a large file, and everything after the
  orphan fence is swallowed into one giant "expression." The file
  still looks structured; parsers disagree about where the next
  object starts.
- Headless table files. A ``tables/*.tmdl`` with no ``table``
  declaration (usually a half-finished refactor) contributes nothing
  but confusion.

The common thread: each of these is trivially cheap to detect and
disproportionately expensive to discover late, because the error
surfaces as a confusing downstream failure ("relationship endpoint
not found," "unexpected token") rather than as "this file is broken."

How the rules detect it
----------------------------

M001 checks the skeleton: the definition folder has a ``model.tmdl``
and a ``tables/`` folder containing at least one ``.tmdl`` file.

M002 sweeps every ``.tmdl`` file recursively: it must decode as
UTF-8, contain no ``\x00`` bytes, and carry an even number of
```` ``` ```` markers; table files must contain a table declaration
the parser can find. Parser failures on individual files are
surfaced through the same rule, so "could not make sense of this
file" is always reported as a well-formedness violation rather than
being silently skipped.

Why there is no auto-fix
-----------------------------

Every failure in this class destroys information. A truncated file
cannot be untruncated; the tool cannot know which of the two fence
positions was intended, or what the missing table declaration should
say. Any "repair" would be an invention. The correct resolution is
human: restore the file from version control, or finish the half-done
edit. What the rule contributes is earliness; you learn about the
damage at your desk, from a message that names the file and the
byte, instead of from a failed deployment that names neither.
