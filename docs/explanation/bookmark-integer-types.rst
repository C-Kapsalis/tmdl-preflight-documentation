Bookmark integer types
======================

Rule B001.

The pitfall
--------------

In a PBIP project the report layer is JSON, and bookmarks
(``*.bookmark.json``) capture exploration state: which visuals are
selected, what filters apply, schema versions. Several of those
fields, ``howCreated``, ``ComparisonKind``, ``Version``, are validated
as JSON numbers. If one arrives as a string, the report loader rejects
the bookmark with:

::

    Invalid type. Expected Number but got String

How does ``2`` become ``"2"``? Almost never by hand. It happens when
bookmark JSON passes through tooling that round-trips values as text:
templating scripts, JSON libraries in stringly-typed languages,
sed-style bulk edits, diff and patch workflows, or an editor
autocompleting quotes. Semantically the value is identical;
``"howCreated": "0"`` reads fine in review. JSON's type system
disagrees, and JSON-schema validation is exact about it.

The failure is also unusually annoying to diagnose: the error names
neither the file nor the path, a report can contain dozens of
bookmarks, and each bookmark nests the offending fields arbitrarily
deep inside ``explorationState``. So a one-character defect costs a
debugging session.

How the rule detects it
----------------------------

Every ``*.bookmark.json`` under each ``*.Report`` folder is loaded and
walked recursively. Any occurrence of the three field names holding a
string value is reported with its full JSON path
(``explorationState.visualContainers.abc123.filters...Version``), so
the fix, manual or automatic, goes straight to the spot. Unparseable
bookmark files are reported by the same rule.

Why the fix is safe
------------------------

This is the purest fixer in the tool, because the repair is a type
correction with zero semantic freedom:

- ``"2"`` to ``2`` is information-preserving in both directions;
  nothing about the bookmark's meaning changes.
- Legacy string spellings of ``howCreated`` with a known meaning are
  mapped (``"User"`` to ``0``, ``"System"`` to ``1``), a documented
  translation, not a guess.
- A string with no known integer meaning
  (``"howCreated": "someday"``) is left alone and stays a violation
  on the re-check. The fixer never invents a value; unknown cases go
  to a human.

The rewrite re-serializes the JSON with standard 2-space indentation,
so the diff is exactly the changed values (plus, at worst, normalized
whitespace on first run). Running the fixer twice is a no-op.
