The imposition pattern
======================

Most linters stop at detection: they tell you what is wrong and leave
the repair to you. ``tmdl-preflight`` treats a class of defects
differently. For violations that are mechanical, where the correct
repair is fully determined by the failure itself, the repair is part
of the run, not a separate chore. This is the imposition pattern: the
tool imposes the invariant rather than merely observing its absence.

The loop
-----------

``tmdl-preflight fix`` executes three phases, strictly in order:

#. Check. Every selected rule runs read-only and reports violations.
#. Fix. Each fixable rule that reported violations applies its
   repair. Fixers edit the files on disk, surgically; they never
   mutate the in-memory model.
#. Re-check. The parse cache is dropped and every rule runs again,
   against what is actually on disk now.

The run is clean only if the re-check is clean. This is the
load-bearing detail: a fixer never gets to vouch for itself. If a
repair was incomplete, wrong, or impossible (a bookmark value with no
known integer meaning, say), the violation is still on the final
report and the exit code is still nonzero. Auto-repair can therefore
never mask a defect; the worst it can do is fail to remove one,
exactly as if it did not exist.

Why fold the fix into the run at all?
-------------------------------------------

Because for mechanical defects, "report and wait for a human" is
strictly worse:

- The human adds no information. When a duplicate ``lineageTag`` must
  become a fresh UUID, there is no judgement call. Routing it through
  a person adds latency and a chance of a hand-edit typo, nothing
  else.
- Defect classes that recur deserve automation. These defects are
  produced by tooling and merges, not by misunderstanding, so they
  recur forever. A fix documented in a wiki gets executed
  inconsistently; a fix encoded in the tool gets executed identically
  every time.
- The check and the fix stay in sync. When detection logic and repair
  logic live together and the re-check arbitrates between them, they
  cannot silently drift apart.

What earns a fixer: the safety contract
----------------------------------------------

Only five of the twenty-one rules ship a fixer, and that is
deliberate. A repair qualifies only if it satisfies all of:

#. The failure mode fully determines the repair. No intent needs to
   be inferred. A duplicate tag needs a fresh unique value; an orphan
   comma needs deletion; a ``"2"`` needs to become ``2``.
#. It never overwrites human-authored semantics. Fixers touch
   identity metadata, separators, and JSON types, never a DAX
   expression, a name, or a relationship.
#. It is idempotent. Running ``fix`` twice produces the same tree as
   running it once.
#. It is minimal. Line-level, targeted edits, so the resulting diff
   is reviewable at a glance.

Counter-examples make the boundary clear. An unbalanced DAX expression
(D001) has infinitely many "balanced" completions; only the author
knows which one is meant, so there is no fixer. A dangling bookmark
reference (B002) could mean restore the visual, retarget the
bookmark, or delete the bookmark, three different intents, so there
is no fixer.

Check-only mode is a first-class citizen
------------------------------------------------

``tmdl-preflight check`` never writes, unconditionally. This split
matters in practice: pipelines and audits run ``check`` (a mutating
gate in CI is a recipe for confusing states), while developers run
``fix`` locally and commit the diff like any other change. The same
discipline is available in pytest through the fixture's ``autofix``
parameter and the ``TMDL_PREFLIGHT_AUTOFIX`` environment variable.
