Stray commas in field-parameter sources
==========================================

Rule F001.

The pitfall
--------------

Field parameters, and calculated tables generally, are defined by a
DAX table constructor: a ``{ ... }`` list of tuples separated by
commas.

::

    {
        ( "Revenue",   NAMEOF ( [Revenue] ),   0 ),
        ( "Orders #",  NAMEOF ( [Orders #] ),  1 ),
        ( "Units Sold", NAMEOF ( [Units Sold] ), 2 )
    }

The maintenance operation this invites is removing a row: a metric is
retired, a measure moves elsewhere. And the natural way to remove a
row in a text editor or a script is to delete the tuple's line, which
leaves its separator behind:

::

    {
        ( "Revenue",   NAMEOF ( [Revenue] ),   0 ),
        ,
        ( "Units Sold", NAMEOF ( [Units Sold] ), 2 )
    }

That orphan comma makes the entire source expression unparseable. And
because a field parameter is infrastructure rather than content, the
blast radius is wide: the parameter's table is invalid, every visual
and slicer driven by it fails, and any calculated table derived from
the parameter (a common pattern, for example a categories table built
by unioning the parameter's rows) fails with it. One character,
several report pages.

Two things make this defect a recurring class rather than a one-off:

- Automation produces it. Scripts that drop rows by matching the
  tuple line are exactly one comma away from correct, forever.
- Commented-out rows camouflage it. Teams park rows with ``--``
  rather than deleting them; a scanner that naively counts commas
  then flags the parked rows and gets ignored, while missing the real
  orphan.

How the rule detects it
----------------------------

For every ``calculated`` partition source in the model, the rule
masks comment contents (length-preserving, so line numbers survive)
and then scans for comma runs: two or more commas separated only by
whitespace (``,,`` and the multi-line orphan case both match). Commas
inside ``--``/``//`` comments never count; a commented-out row is an
intentional parking, not a defect. The scan covers all calculated
tables, not only field parameters, because the failure mode is
identical for any table-constructor source.

Why the fix is safe
------------------------

The repair collapses each run to its first comma, the live separator
between the two surviving rows, and deletes only the orphans. Its
safety comes from a precise observation about the failure mode:

- The orphan commas are, by construction, the leftover of the row
  that was already deleted. Removing them completes a deletion the
  author already made; it does not make any new decision.
- Nothing else in the expression is touched: whitespace, comments,
  and all surviving tuples are byte-for-byte preserved, and the edit
  is applied only inside the partition-source block's line range in
  the file.
- It is idempotent; once no run of two or more commas exists, the
  fixer has nothing to match.

The one thing the fixer deliberately does not do is decide whether
the row should have been deleted; if the deletion itself was the
mistake, that shows up as a dangling ``NAMEOF`` reference, which is
:doc:`nameof-reference-integrity`'s job to report and a human's job
to resolve.
