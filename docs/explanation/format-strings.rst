Format strings
==============

Rule S001.

The pitfall
--------------

A measure without a ``formatString`` is not broken; it deploys,
computes, and renders. It just renders raw: ``1234567.891`` instead
of ``$1,234,568``, ``0.0523`` instead of ``5.2%``. The costs are
small individually and large in aggregate:

- Misreading. ``0.0523`` sitting where a reader expects a percentage
  is an invitation to be off by a factor of a hundred. Formatting is
  not cosmetics; it encodes the unit.
- Inconsistency. When some measures are formatted and others are
  not, every report page becomes a patchwork, and every visual
  author fixes it locally, creating divergent per-visual formatting
  that overrides whatever the model later decides.
- Invisibility in review. The absence of a property is much harder
  to spot in a diff than a wrong property. New measures merge in
  unformatted and nobody notices until a stakeholder does.

Why only ``info`` severity, when the reasoning above sounds like a
warning? Because presence of ``formatString`` is a proxy, and a proxy
can be legitimately false: mature models often apply formats
dynamically through a calculation group whose format-string
expressions compute the format at query time (multi-currency models,
unit toggles). In such a model, most measures intentionally carry no
static ``formatString``, and a blocking rule would train users to
ignore the tool.

How the rule detects it
----------------------------

Every visible (non-hidden) measure without a ``formatString`` is
reported as ``info``. Hidden measures are exempt; they are internal
plumbing whose formatting nobody sees. And if the model contains any
``formatStringDefinition`` block (the calculation-group
dynamic-formatting mechanism), the rule exempts the whole model
automatically, on the logic above. If your formatting strategy lives
somewhere the rule cannot see, per-visual formatting by policy, for
instance, silence it explicitly with ``--ignore S001``.

Why there is no auto-fix
-----------------------------

The right format is domain knowledge: is ``Discount Rate`` a
percentage or a ratio? Is ``Revenue`` dollars, euros, or "whatever the
currency slicer says"? A fixer would have to guess units from names,
and a wrong guess is worse than no format; it confidently displays the
wrong unit. The rule keeps the gap visible; the human supplies the
meaning.
