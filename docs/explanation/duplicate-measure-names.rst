Duplicate measure names
=======================

Rule D003.

The pitfall
--------------

Columns are scoped to their table: ``Sales[quantity]`` and
``Returns[quantity]`` coexist happily. Measures are not. In the
tabular model, measure names are unique across the entire model; a
measure merely lives in a home table for organizational purposes, but
its name is global, which is why DAX references it as ``[Revenue]``
with no table qualifier.

Text-file workflows walk straight into this. Copying a table file to
scaffold a similar one copies its measures. A merge keeps both sides'
version of a measure that one branch moved to a different home
table; each file is individually valid, and no textual conflict is
reported, because the two declarations live in different files. Power
BI Desktop would have refused the second declaration interactively; a
git merge has no such opinion.

The result is a model the engine rejects at import. And even before
deployment, duplicates poison anything that resolves measures by
name: ``NAMEOF([Revenue])`` becomes ambiguous, and tooling that looks
measures up model-wide picks one of the two arbitrarily.

How the rule detects it
----------------------------

All measures from all tables are indexed by name; any name declared
more than once is reported at every occurrence after the first, with
the first occurrence's table, file, and line in the message so both
halves of the collision are one click away. ``NAMEOF`` ambiguity
warnings from :doc:`nameof-reference-integrity` are the same disease
observed from the reference side; D003 errors on the disease itself.

Why there is no auto-fix
-----------------------------

The two declarations usually differ; one is stale, one is current, or
they were never meant to be the same measure at all. Deleting one
requires knowing which; renaming one requires knowing what every
report and expression referencing ``[Revenue]`` intended. Both are
judgement calls, so the rule fails plainly and shows both locations.
