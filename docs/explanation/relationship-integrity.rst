Relationship integrity
======================

Rules R001, R002, and R003.

The pitfall
--------------

Relationships are declared in their own file, ``relationships.tmdl``,
by naming their endpoints:

::

    relationship 1f6f2b3a-8c1d-4e5f-9a70-1b2c3d4e5f60
        fromColumn: Sales.product_id
        toColumn: Products.product_id

That separation is the vulnerability. The tables live in
``tables/*.tmdl``; the relationships that bind them live somewhere
else entirely, so the two drift independently. Rename a column in its
table file and the relationship keeps pointing at the old name.
Delete a table and its relationships stay behind. Cherry-pick a
commit that adds a relationship without the commit that adds the
column. No single file looks wrong; the model as a whole is broken,
and the break is exactly the kind a file-by-file code review misses.

A broken endpoint is a hard failure at import. But the softer failure
modes matter just as much:

- Cardinality typos (``fromCardinality: both``,
  ``toCardinality: 1``) are not values the engine accepts; ``one``
  and ``many`` are the entire menu.
- Duplicate relationships over the same column pair usually come
  from a merge keeping both sides. At best the engine rejects the
  second; at worst tooling behaves inconsistently about which one is
  "the" relationship.

A note on identity: relationships also carry GUIDs, but two models
that are semantically identical can have entirely different
relationship GUIDs (re-saving a model regenerates them). Anything
that compares or deduplicates relationships must therefore key on the
endpoints, the from and to table-column pairs, never on the GUID.
``tmdl-preflight`` follows that principle in R003.

How the rules detect it
----------------------------

The relationships file is parsed with a quote-aware reference parser
(table names may contain spaces and escaped quotes:
``'Store ''B'''.id``). Then:

- R001 resolves each endpoint against the parsed model: the table
  must exist, and the named column must exist on it. Each missing
  half is a separate error naming the relationship.
- R002 checks declared cardinalities against ``{one, many}``.
- R003 indexes relationships by their endpoint 4-tuple and flags
  every re-declaration of an already-seen pair (a warning; some
  pipelines tolerate a duplicate if only one is active, but it is
  virtually never intended).

Why there is no auto-fix
-----------------------------

Every repair here requires intent. A relationship pointing at a
renamed column could be retargeted, but the tool cannot know the
rename happened, versus the column being deliberately removed (in
which case the relationship should be deleted too). Of two duplicate
relationships, which survives depends on which side of the merge was
right about ``isActive`` and cross-filter direction. The rules make
the drift visible at the moment it is introduced; the resolution
stays with the person who knows why the change was made.
